      <p>
         A resume is often the most important document of our professional life, laying down how and why we are wherever we are, and what we can do the best. All with an underlying essence of our personality. Looking for a job can be quite an unnerving experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Getting that first interview call really matters. A lot depends on making the right first impression. A good resume can make all the difference.

         An average recruiter spends less than 10 minutes reading each resume. If your resume doesn’t stand out, you’re not likely to receive a call back.

       <p>
         Put simply, a resume is a medium for <b>pitching yourself</b> to your future employer. A resume should tell a story. Everyone has their own story to tell. The more compelling your narrative is, the more the chances of your resume finding its way to the higher levels, the decision-makers of the organization or company. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Adopting a holistic approach is important, giving the reader of your resume a clear and complete analysis of your educational background and professional journey. While you get your study and career path clearly laid down, you must always add value to the reader. Talk facts, but get to the point.  
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Keeping it simple, short, and to the point</b> is more important than ever in the highly-competitive world that we find ourselves in. A lengthy narrative might appear to be dragging and off-course. 
      </p>
      <p>
         A concise facts-only story, on the other hand, has all the potential for really piquing the reader’s curiosity. A curiosity that would naturally translate into interest. 
      </p>
      <p>
         An understanding of the current industry trends is also important to understand what precisely the company might be looking for in a specific position. Find out what are the most sought-after skills and strengths in your industry at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another key factor, often underestimated by applicants, is the <b>Cover Letter</b>. Don’t make the common mistake of going with the same Cover Letter for every position that you apply to. 
      </p>
      <p>
         A unique Cover Letter should ideally be written for each <b>job opening</b> that you apply to. The impression to be conveyed here is that you have taken the time and made the effort to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
         Dashing off the same Cover Letter to all - only changing the addressee and company details - may be quicker, but it might also work against you. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Over 70% of resumes that are submitted never reach human eyes. A majority get filtered through the Application Tracking System (ATS), a software used by companies for shortlisting candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
         Scanning resumes and other job-related documents against a set of pre-determined keywords - such as job titles, technical skills, and educational background - the ATS determines whether or not an applicant is qualified for a specific job opening.  
      </p>
      <p>
         Passing the automated ATS scan and progressing onto the interview stage takes a bit of work. To be able to pass the ATS scan, your resume must have all the right words in the correct formatting. Getting an ATS-friendly resume is the perfect way to land your dream job.

       </ul>
       <p>
         Here, <b>ATS stands for the Application Tracking System</b>, software used by companies and recruiters to sift through the profiles on their terms. A resume must be ATS-friendly to make it past the initial screening stage.
      </p>
      <p>
         An ATS-friendly resume is one that is formatted using an <b>ATS-compliant resume template</b>, contains all the industry-specific keywords, and is worth the time of the human recruiter.
      </p>
      <p>
         Resumes that get through the ATS are the ones that reach the hiring manager. The rest generally don’t make it beyond the initial <b>screening process</b>, getting held-up and stalled by the ATS.
      </p>
      <p>
         As per an estimate, reportedly around 75% of applicants are disqualified by the ATS software itself. Never to reach a hiring manager that might actually get down to reading the resume. 
      </p>
      <p>
         An ATS-friendly resume is specifically designed for getting a green signal from the Application Tracking System put in place by a particular company.
      </p>
      <p>
         The cornerstone of an ATS-compliant resume is the ease and readability quotient. A resume that is difficult to read and understand, using complex and ambiguous words, might not get past the ATS. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Similarly, removing images and tables and including keywords from the given job description make your resume more ATS-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
         Always create your resume with ATS software in mind, thereby ensuring that your job application stands a much better chance to reach a hiring manager.

        <h4 class=" fs-4 bg-gradient-dark text-white px-4 border-radius-lg shadow font-weight-normal">How to make an ATS-friendly resume?</h4>
        <p>
         There are many ways to make sure that your resume gets past the initial screening ATS software. Any changes made in your resume with ATS in mind can definitely increase the chances of your resume being shortlisted and forwarded to the right channel. 
      </p>
      <p class="font-weight-bold">
        Five ways to make your resume more ATS-friendly -  
      </p>
        
        <ul style="line-height: 2;"class="mt-4">
         <li style="list-style-image: url(picture/icon/b1.png);">

         </li>
         <li style="list-style-image: url(picture/icon/b1.png);">
           Chronological format 
         </li> 
         <li style="list-style-image: url(picture/icon/b1.png);">
           ATS-friendly template 
         </li>
         <li style="list-style-image: url(picture/icon/b1.png);">
           Save in the right format 
         </li> 
       </ul>
       <p>
         ATS software scans your resume for various <b>industry-specific and job-related keywords</b> relevant to the position applied for. While some ATS software might use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to determine your eligibility, older software might simply scan your resume for certain <b>keywords</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
         Include the words from the job listing in your resume. A match between the job listing keywords and the resume or cover letter resume keywords increase the likelihood of your profile getting into the interview pool. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
         The specific skills mentioned in the job description should be included in the skills or core competencies section on your resume, thereby signaling the ATS that you are qualified for the job in consideration. 
      </p>
      <p>
         The importance of proper labeling can hardly be overstated. Avoid playing around with headings to come up with something that might confuse the ATS, for example, “why I’m great?”, “jobs I’ve done”. Keep it simple and basic. Put the commonly-used headings, such as, 
      </p>
      <p>
         The specific skills mentioned in the job description should be included in the skills or core competencies section on your "skills”, “work experience”, “education” etc.
      </p>
      <p>
         Provided there are no long gaps in the employment history, the chronological resume is the most suitable format for most applicants. Beginning from the current or most recent employment, proceed on to the previous work experience in chronological order, ending with your first job.
      </p>
      <p>
         The chronological approach is the best way for emphasizing and organizing your work experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Select an ATS-friendly resume template. Keep in mind that resumes that have unique fonts or too many graphic elements might be difficult for ATS software to scan.
      </p>
      <p>
         Fonts to be used in a resume must be those commonly-used and easy to read for the ATS software. It is recommended to stick to the basic fonts, such as Arial, Times New Roman etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
         If there is no specific requirement as to the kind of file format to save your resume in, you can save your resume either as a pdf or in .docx format. Older ATS software might face issues with understanding resume pdf files.
